# Tetris Game

This is a Tetris game developed using Python with Pygame and OpenCV. The game includes customizable themes, camera-based controls, particle effects, sound effects, and a SQLite database for storing scores and statistics.

## Features
- Selectable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Customizable visual themes (e.g., space, jungle).
- Camera-based control using OpenCV (detecting pink objects).
- Visual effects for line clears.
- Score and statistics storage (games played, total time).
- Sound effects for actions (move, rotate, line clear).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pygame`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`
- A webcam (optional, for camera control)
